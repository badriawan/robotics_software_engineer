First, launch the turtlebot3 empty world.
i the other terminal, run : ros2 run module_5_assignment lqr_node
in the third terminal , run : ros2 run rqt_gui rqt_gui with dynamic configurastion and visualization of odom linear topic.




To check the graph result , kindly check LQR folder
    The graph illustrates relationship betweem marices Q and R penalties on LQR controller model through differential mobile robot. The x axis refers to timestep in seconds unit
then the Y axis represents odom topic messages in position x for blue line and position y for the red one. The robot move from one checlpoint and another using velocities v and w 
as an input.The checlpoints in coordinates x and y are ; 1,1 ; 2,2 ; 3,3 ; 4,4 then return to the start psotion at 0,0.
    Based on the graph's plot, the default value of the penalties is 0.8 .Additionally, this value create the default movement of robot as well as the graph showed.Next , when
i tried to increase the value of Q penalties, there are no significant change.Otherwise , when Q penalties reduce,the error position of the robots increase with the similar 
value of velocities and time travel.Futhermore, the factor of R penalties value also generate an essential point for the controller.First, if we decrease the value of penalties,
the robots become unstable .However , if we rise up the value of R penalties, the robot is going to more significantly stable.
    In conclusion, determining the LQR controller Q and R matirces is generated a crucial effect for the controller.For more information, I didn't apply more high tuned value
due to the limitation of time. Last but not least, We have to make sure our value of Q and R in proper value by trial and error to optimize the best controller.
